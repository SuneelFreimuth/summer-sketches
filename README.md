# summer-sketches
A collection of p5js animations posted to my Instagram during the summer of 2019.

## Run the Sketches
Easiest way to do it is to install p5-manager, a program for quickly creating and managing
p5 sketches.
```
sudo npm install -g p5-manager
```
Then, enter the `sketches/` directory and run
```
p5 server
```
You will be able to flip through the sketches by clicking the star at the top left.
