# summer-sketches
A collection of [p5js](https://p5js.org/) animations posted to my Instagram during the summer of 2019.

## Run the Sketches
I recommend installing `p5-manager`, a program for quickly creating and managing
p5 sketches.
```
sudo npm install -g p5-manager
```
Then, enter the `sketches/` directory and run
```
p5 server
```
You will be able to flip through the sketches by clicking the star at the top left.
